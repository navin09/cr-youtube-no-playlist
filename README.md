# YouTube No Playlist!

This extension for Chrome/Chromium allows you to open YouTube videos from a playlist
in a new tab as standalone videos without the (autoplaying) playlist.

This is a port of the Firefox extension with the same name created by [Klemens Sch√∂lhorn](https://klemens.schoelhorn.eu/).
